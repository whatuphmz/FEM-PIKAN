# [FEM-PIKAN](https://github.com/whatuphmz/FEM-PIKAN)
FEM-PIKAN is an open-source computational framework that deeply integrates the Finite Element Method (FEM) with Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKAN) to deliver high-precision, scalable predictions of static mechanical responses in complex shell geometries.
While traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often struggle with limited network capacity, suboptimal training accuracy, and inadequate enforcement of physical constraints on intricate geometries, FEM-PIKAN overcomes these challenges by spatially discretizing shell structures via FEM, solving equilibrium equations at each mesh node, and embedding these equations directly into the neural network loss function.

The schematic of FEM-PIKAN is as follows:
