# [FEM-PIKAN](https://github.com/whatuphmz/FEM-PIKAN)
FEM-PIKAN is an open-source computational framework that deeply integrates the Finite Element Method (FEM) with Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKAN) to deliver high-precision, scalable predictions of static mechanical responses in complex shell geometries.

While traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often struggle with limited network capacity, suboptimal training accuracy, and inadequate enforcement of physical constraints on intricate geometries, FEM-PIKAN overcomes these challenges by spatially discretizing shell structures via FEM, solving equilibrium equations at each mesh node, and embedding these equations directly into the neural network loss function.
